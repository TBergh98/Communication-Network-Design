This Folder contains the **csv file** obtained with wireshark, the **report** and the
**code** used to obtain the results.

The **recommended** way to "read the code" is by using the provided "jupyter
notebook" (.ipynb file). If you don't have jupyter on your laptop you can run it
in your browser at [https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/].

Alternatively I provided also a .py file for your convenience.

If you want to run the code remember to set the variable `filepath`
(in the first lines of the code) to the right value.
